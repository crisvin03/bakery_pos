# Alvarez Bakery â€” Sales Forecasting & Management (POS)

Roles implemented:
- **Admin (Owner)**: Full access (Products CRUD, Sales, Forecast & Analytics, Reports export)
- **Cashier (Staff)**: POS only (create sales, discounts, receipt printing)

Quick start (SQLite):
```bash
cd alvarez_bakery
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
# (Optional) seed demo data
python manage.py seed_demo
python manage.py runserver
```

- Use the superuser for Admin access. To create a cashier, create a standard user (not staff).
  Cashiers can log in and use the POS, but can't access products, reports, or forecast pages.

- In `alvarez_bakery/settings.py`, replace the `DATABASES` section with the MySQL block and set your creds.
